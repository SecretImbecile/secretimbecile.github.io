                                <p>Point solitude is game modification project for <a href="http://www.nolimitscoaster.com/" target="_blank">Nolimits 2 Roller Coaster Simulation</a> that I have undertaken to gain experience in game development from an artists perspective. The project allowed me to take full control of an art workflow, and has given me experience in 3D Modelling in Blender3D, texture creation, lighting, optimisation, and basic 3D shaders.</p>
                                <p>The previous iteration of the project can be viewed in <a href="https://youtu.be/cYnDkpDDmS0" target="_blank">this video</a></p>.

				<p>Game of Hex is a game I am developing in Unity3D. </p>
				<p> My focus in creating this game is not in art or to some extent gameplay. Instead,
				in creating this game I hope to gain practical knowledge of basic AI, additional data structures,
				terrain generation and programming a codebase that I anticipate will grow to a scale I've never attempted
				to manage before.</p>
				<p> The code for this game is being written in object-oriented C#. The game will be a
				turn-based strategy game, with inspiration from chess and other hexagon-grid based games like
				the Civilisation series.</p>
