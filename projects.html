				Game of Hex is a game I am developing in Unity3D. </p>
				<p> My focus in creating this game is not in art or to some extent gameplay. Instead,
				in creating this game I hope to gain practical knowledge of basic AI, additional data structures,
				terrain generation and programming a codebase that I anticipate will grow to a scale I've never attempted
				to manage before.</p>
				<p> The code for this game is being written in object-oriented C#. The game will be a
				turn-based strategy game, with inspiration from chess and other hexagon-grid based games like
				the Civilisation series.
